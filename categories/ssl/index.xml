http://letsencrypt.org is cool, because it provides SSL certs for all of your domains for free! The only thing which is a bit challenging is that you have to renew your certs every 3 months. I made a script which, monthly triggered by cron, can do this for you.
This script assumes you&amp;rsquo;re using nginx webserver (which is reloaded by the script after recreating certs) and that your domains are located in &amp;ldquo;/var/www/domain.</description>
