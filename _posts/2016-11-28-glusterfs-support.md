Unfortunately GlusterFS is in the Ubuntu multiverse repository. Therefore Libvirt, Qemu & Samba and other packages from universe repository are build without GlusterFS LibGfApi support.

For this reason i have created some PPAs on Launchpad which contain these packages with GlusterFS support.

Just visit: https://launchpad.net/~monotek
