Unfortunately GlusterFS is in the Ubuntu universe repository. Therefore Libvirt, Qemu & Samba and other packages from main repository are build without GlusterFS LibGfApi support.

For this reason i have created some PPAs on Launchpad which contain these packages with GlusterFS support.

Just visit: [https://launchpad.net/~monotek](https://launchpad.net/~monotek)

Updates to this PPAs are announced on my [Twitter channel](https://twitter.com/mono_tek)
